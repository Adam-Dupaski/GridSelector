# Grid Selector

## Description
This widget creates a grid, consisting of a list of objects to the left and one at the top. The checkboxes can then be used to set the reference connecting the two.
It lets you quickly set a lot of references over/for a lot of objects

Supports both *references* (radiobuttons) and *referencesets* (checkboxes).
